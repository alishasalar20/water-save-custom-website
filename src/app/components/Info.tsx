            <strong>Water Waste and Its Global Impact:</strong> Water wastage is a growing issue that affects agriculture, the economy, and global ecosystems. According to the United Nations, approximately 70% of the worldâ€™s freshwater is used for agriculture, and a substantial portion of this is wasted due to poor irrigation practices and inefficient water management.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            It&apos;s estimated that in some areas, 40-50% of irrigation water never reaches the crops. This has a significant impact on crop yield and food production.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            As a result, regions that rely on agriculture for their livelihoods are seeing droughts, crop failures, and loss of productivity. For example, the California drought of 2015 resulted in a $2.7 billion loss in crops. The problem is also exacerbated by the over-extraction of groundwater, which has led to sinking water tables in some areas, making water more difficult to access for farming.
